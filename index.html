        <h3>So who is this dude anyway?</h3>
            <p>Ashton Balder is a chronic procrastinator who's really good at being good at things and being able to do them quickly, 
                <br>but the SECOND he has to do something he's not good at, 
                <br> that ACTUALLY forces him to exert about as-much-or-more mental effort than a Texas Instruments calculator from 1998, 
                <br>he kinda falls apart.
                <br>Still a halfway-decent dude, and pretty solid at music (but that doesn't pay, so pay me to make your website.  I promise I'll try on the next one).</p>

        <h3>So why do I care about this guy?</h3>
            <p>'Cuz man's already done a bunch of projects, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Higher-Lower Guessing Game</li>
                        <li>*Quick FYI, these will just take you to the Github repo.  They refuse to link properly, and I have no patience to see it through for an old projects I'm trying to put behind me (for good reason)</li>
